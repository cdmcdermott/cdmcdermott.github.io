      <description>The feeling of security and the reality of security don&amp;rsquo;t always match, says computer-security expert Bruce Schneier.
In his talk, he explains why we spend billions addressing news story risks, like the security theater now playing at your local airport, while neglecting more probable risks &amp;ndash; and how we can break this pattern</description>

      <description>A fascinating video by Perry Carpenter about the Psychology of attack and defence In the video Perry explains the art and science behind deception. Also, how threat actors use this knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities in human psychology to target end-users and how security awareness training can help users spot deception.
A great watch to better understand social engineering, scams, disinformation campaigns, and much more.</description>

      <description>Amazon recently announced the launch of a new service: Amazon Sidewalk which appears to have caused quite a stir. The tech giant has come under fire for the way it has rolled out the new service, amid concerns regarding user privacy and security.
Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly review the service to decide whether it is a useful new feature or a cause for concern.
What is Amazon Sidewalk? The first thing to note is that at present the service has only launched in the US.</description>

      <title>Is it safe to use a browser&#39;s built-in password manager</title>

      <description>I read an interesting article about Password Managers written by Tavis Ormandy, a well known researcher working on Googleâ€™s Zero-Day project. The article considered whether it is better to use the intrinsic password manager already built-in to your web browser (most web browsers now offer to save your passwords) or to use an extrinsic third-party app like Bitwarden .
Let&amp;rsquo;s review the arguments he presented in his article and determine if it is safe to use a browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in password manager.</description>

      <description>Tech giants: Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon were questioned by a US Congress subcommittee yesterday on issues relating to antitrust, and the suggestion they hold too much power. For nearly six hours, congress confronted the CEOs about whether they wielded their market power to eliminate competitors and amass huge data on their customers. Indeed, congressman David Cicilline summarised the hearing by suggesting:
Simply put, they have too much power. The firms have monopoly power, some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable &amp;ndash; David Cicilline</description>

      <title>Why Security Matters</title>

      <description>We all know (hopefully) we should take security seriously. Indeed, the frequency and impact of security threats continue to evolve, with new threats emerging almost daily. We also have to acknowledge that we live in a highly connected world using technology and the Internet daily to gather information from websites, collaborate on projects, connect remote employees to company networks, or utilise cloud platforms to do business. Each of the activities exposes us to some element of risk, therefore, it is fair to say that completely avoiding risk is probably impossible.</description>
