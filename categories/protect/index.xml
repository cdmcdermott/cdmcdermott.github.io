      <description>Welcome A web browser can collect a lot of information about you. As the tool most used to browse the Internet, they can track the sites you visit, how long you spent on them, which links you clicked on or purchases you made, and much more. Choosing the right web browser is, therefore, an important consideration when trying to improve your online privacy.
Ideally, you should choose a web browser which blocks all trackers by default, or at least, allows you to easily configure it do so.</description>

      <description>In a recent article, How to create and manage strong passwords, I demonstrated how using mnemonics to remember complex passwords or adopting a bitwarden can be used to improve your digital security, and make you a much more difficult target for potential hackers. It is, however, possible to protect your online digital interactions even further, by using Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add extra layers of security when logging into systems.</description>

      <description>We all know we should use secure passwords, but, how do you balance the necessity of highly secure passwords with the ability to easily recall them when needed? Depending on which study you read, the average person has 27 online accounts and between 70-80 passwords to remember. As a result, many people choose the path of least resistance (Iâ€™m working on a future post about this) so either use simple, easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or use the same password everywhere.</description>
