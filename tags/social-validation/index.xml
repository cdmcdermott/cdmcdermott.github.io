      <description>So last week I took the plunge. I started my Blog and mailing list . Itâ€™s something I have been thinking about doing for a while, but always managed to find an excuse not to start, sound familiar ? This got me thinking about a quote I recently heard by Stoic philosopher, Epictetus:
 If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid - Epictetus
 I think his point is that often the fear of looking foolish can cripple us and prevent us from starting a new venture or applying for a dream job or starting a blog.</description>
