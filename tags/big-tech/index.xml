      <description>Amazon recently announced the launch of a new service: Amazon Sidewalk which appears to have caused quite a stir. The tech giant has come under fire for the way it has rolled out the new service, amid concerns regarding user privacy and security.
Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly review the service to decide whether it is a useful new feature or a cause for concern.
 What is Amazon Sidewalk? The first thing to note is that at present the service has only launched in the US.</description>

      <description>The Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) published the findings of a study this week which investigated the impact of technology on mental health in adolescents.
The study investigated engagement with smartphones, social media and television and reported finding little evidence to suggest an increased association between technology use and mental health exists.
I found these findings somewhat surprising so decided to dig a little deeper.
Firstly, information about new digital media has only been collected for a relatively short time, therefore, drawing firm conclusions about the impact on mental health at this stage may be premature.</description>

      <description>I probably don’t need to tell you the markets have been on a wild ride in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak. However, interestingly according to Forbes during this time, many of the same companies responsible for powering the recent decade-long bull market have gained even more clout, with tech behemoths Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft now accounting for over 22% of the S&amp;amp;P. That’s up from a 15 % share in 2018.</description>
