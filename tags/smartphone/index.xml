      <description>The Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) published the findings of a study this week which investigated the impact of technology on mental health in adolescents.
The study investigated engagement with smartphones, social media and television and reported finding little evidence to suggest an increased association between technology use and mental health exists.
I found these findings somewhat surprising so decided to dig a little deeper.
Firstly, information about new digital media has only been collected for a relatively short time, therefore, drawing firm conclusions about the impact on mental health at this stage may be premature.</description>
