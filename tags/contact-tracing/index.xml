      <description>It appears the UK government have decided to scrap their NHS contact tracing app in favour of a model based on Google and Appleâ€™s technology. In doing so, it joins a host of other countries (including Germany, Italy and Denmark) to favour a decentralised system developed by the Silicon Valley giants, rather than a centralised model developed locally. A step in the right direction ?
There has been much debate and concern about the need and function of contact tracing apps to fight the current global pandemic.</description>
