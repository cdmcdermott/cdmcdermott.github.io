The Artful Dodger was a pickpocket, so called for his skill and cunning in that occupation.\nArtful (adjective) in clever and skilful ways\nEnigma (noun) a person or thing that is mysterious or difficult to understand\nLife is short and there is a lot I would like to achieve. I don’t want my interactions on the Internet to be manipulated and exploited by others (hackers or big tech) but rather I seek to be in full control of my digital life. As such, I try to cultivate skills and habits that promote a healthy relationship with technology and protect my online presence.\n What I am thinking about For those who are new to my work, I’ve created a short summary of the main ideas I explore in my writing.\n Human-centred Security: By understanding humans and their interactions with technologies, controls and data I explore the circumstances where psychological-related errors can lead to security incidents. Specifically, how attackers use methods of psychological manipulation to coerce humans into making errors. I seek to understand and manage psychological vulnerabilities, and develop technologies and controls that are designed with human behaviour in mind.\n  Exploitation of human psychology: I am interested in exploring the mismatch between our natural human sensitivities and the exponential growth, power and influence of technology. I seek to explore the persuasive nature of technology and how it can exploit psychological vulnerabilities to shape attitudes and behaviour. Specifically, the growing paradox that exists between our desire for privacy and lack of privacy-preserving behaviour when interacting on the Internet. Also, the breakdown of truth online (Fake news and misinformation) and identification of trustworthy content.\n  Overdependence on technology: Technology has permeated into every area of our lives. However, a severe over reliance, or an addiction to certain facets of its use, can have devastating effects on our health. While technology can fulfil our natural human need for stimulation and interaction, it can also impact the pleasure systems of the brain, replace activities which make us human and be used as an escape from reality. I seek to explore ways to be more intentional with our use of technology, using it to support our goals and values, rather than letting it use us.\n  What I am working on now I am currently exploring the issues highlighted above and assimilating these into an appropriate theory and framework of strategies.\nMy aim is to help us optimise our use of technology such that all our digital interactions are safe, healthy and support the values and ambitions we each hold.\n See more here: philosophy\n  Personal Information Chris McDermott’s birthday is August 16, 1985.
