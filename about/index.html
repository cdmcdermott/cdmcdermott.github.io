For my PhD I explored the perception and awareness of secure and insecure behaviour and developed a multi-modal interface to improve cyber situational awareness. I currently teach digital privacy and security at Robert Gordon University .\nIn addition to my academic research I also write about challenges at the intersection between humans and technology. Specifically, societies increasing addiction to technology, and decreasing concern for privacy. My aim with this writing is to inspire critical thinking. Thinking that is clear,rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence. By promoting awareness of these issues and encouraging people to live more intentionally with technology, I hope to help people think before trading their freedom and privacy for convenience.\nI would like to invite you to consider a new philosophy I propose called Digital Balance. A philosophy which encourages you to rethink how you use technology, so you can become happier, healthier, and more productive. Specifically, I will show you how to optimise your use of technology to ensure that all your digital interactions are safe, secure and support the values and ambitions you hold.\nThis site is, however, more than a blog. It hosts all of my writing on Digital: Security, Privacy, and Minimalism. But, also highlights the concerns around digital health and the strategies you can use to achieve Digital Balance. In addition, my aim is to engage in topical debate, and inspire critical thinking. Thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence.\nFinally, if you would like receive exclusive advice and insights on this topic, you should definitely join my growing newsletter, the McDermott Musings. Every Monday, I send out an exclusive email where I share some thoughts about subjects I’ve been pondering, along with links to books, articles and videos which I think you will find interesting.\n Sign up for my Mailing list   Where did the name aRtFuL eNiGmA come from The name was inspired by a character in Charles Dickens' 1838 novel Oliver Twist. The Artful Dodger was a pickpocket, so called for his skill and cunning in that occupation.\nArtful (adjective) in clever and skilful ways\nEnigma (noun) a person or thing that is mysterious or difficult to understand\nSince I value my freedom and privacy I try to cultivate skills which promote a healthy relationship with technology and protect my online prescence, thus maintain my privacy and security.\n What I am thinking about For those who are new to my work, I’ve created a short summary of the main ideas I explore in my writing.\n Human-centred Security: By understanding humans and their interaction with technologies, controls and data I explore the circumstances where psychological-related errors may lead to security incidents. Attackers have been using methods of psychological manipulation to coerce humans into making errors for years. I seek to understand and manage psychological vulnerabilities, and explore technology and controls that are designed with human behaviour in mind.\n  Human commoditisation through technology: I am interested in exploring the mismatch between our natural human sensitivities and the exponential growth, power and influence of technology. I seek to raise awareness about the massive extraction and monetisation of our thoughts, emotions, and actions; and the resultant harmful side effects, such as our need for social validation, and breakdown of truth.\n  Human dependance on technology: Technology has permeated into every area of our lives. However, a severe over reliance, or an addiction to certain facets of its use, can have devastating effects on our health. While technology can fulfil our natural human need for stimulation and interaction, it can also impact the pleasure systems of the brain, and be used as a boredom buster, social lubricant, or escape from reality. I seek to explore ways to be more intentional with our use of technology, using it to support our goals and values, rather than letting it use us.\n  What I am working on now I am currently exploring the issues highlighted above and assimilating these into an appropriate philosophy and associated strategies.\nMy aim is to help us optimise our use of technology such that all our digital interactions are safe, healthy and support the values and ambitions we each hold.\n See more here: philosophy\n  Selected Published work   M.
