The tech giant has come under fire for the way it has rolled out the new service, amid concerns regarding user privacy and security.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s briefly review the service to decide whether it is a useful new feature or a cause for concern.\nWhat is Amazon Sidewalk? The first thing to note is that at present the service has only launched in the US. Obviously, it could be expanded to other regions at a later date, so users from other regions may also wish to continue reading.\nSecondly, the service has been launched on an opt out basis, meaning if users do nothing they will automatically become a member the new service.\nSo what is Amazon Sidewalk?\nThe purpose of Sidewalk is to link tens of millions of Amazon and Ring smart devices (see list below) in order extend their range and improve their connectivity. By linking the devices together, Amazon will create new proprietary neighbourhood-wide networks where smart devices will be able to communicate even when a users WiFi service is poor or unavailable. So, in theory, if your broadband goes down at home, your Alexa, smart doorbell or security camera would still be able to operate thanks to its connection to other Sidewalk-enabled devices in your neighbourhood (up to 500m).\nTo achieve this, a small portion of a users home broadband connection will be dedicated to maintain connectivity to the Sidewalk network and allow Sidewalk enabled devices in the neighbourhood to communicate. The bandwidth used by the service is quite low and is capped at 500mb per month and 80kbps bandwidth at any given time. To put this into perspective this is roughly the same amount of bandwidth needed to stream 10 minutes of high definition video.\nAmazon were quick to point out in their Whitepaper that although the Sidewalk network will use a portion of a users home broadband connection, the devices that use the network do not have access to the users WiFi network or data. Likewise, a users home WiFi network does not have access to neighbouring smart devices or data.\nFinally, Amazon claim to have carefully designed privacy protections into how Sidewalk collects, stores, and uses data and metadata. Data sent and received on the Sidewalk network is protected using three layers of encryption, similar to how the Onion Router network works.\nAffected devices Compatible devices which can participate in Amazon Sidewalk are called a Sidewalk Bridge and include:\nAmazon Echo (2nd generation onwards) Echo Dot (all) Echo Plus (all) Echo Show (all) Echo Spot (BLE only) Echo Studio (BLE only) Ring Floodlight Cam (BLE only) Spotlight Cam (BLE only) My Thoughts Reading the Documentation provided by Amazon you do get a sense that they have carefully designed security and privacy protections into how Sidewalk collects, stores, and uses data and metadata. However, Sidewalk and the supported devices are not open-source, meaning users have to basically trust Amazon that the system works as advertised and does not have any undocumented weaknesses.\nSecondly, the auto opt-in approach Amazon has used is disappointing. Many users will not take the time to investigate the service and will simply do nothing. In essence, they will fail to grasp the impact of the option and will automatically become members of the service. A service such as this will only work if there is high take up by users. Amazon know this, and appear to be leveraging this to their advantage.\nThirdly, the fact these devices can be automatically updated with new services that are activated unless the user intervenes shows that users are not in full control of their devices. Ultimately, Amazon are dictating how users should use their devices.\nFinally, while the service appears to be secure at present there is potential for problems down the line. For example, if Amazon\u0026rsquo;s update process was compromised in the future an attacker could easily perform malicious changes to the devices without the user knowing. Also, since the new Sidewalk network will be running as a background service users will not be actively monitoring what the devices are doing. If a future vulnerability was found and exploited by hackers malware or viruses could spread very quickly across the tens of millions of devices using the Sidewalk network.\nConclusion Having reviewed what Amazon Sidewalk is, and how it works, we can now try to answer our original question:\nIs Amazon Sidewalk safe or should I opt out?\nHaving read the Whitepaper provided by Amazon it would appear that the Sidewalk Network is safe to use (for now). Of course, this does require us to trust Amazon that the system works as advertised and does not have any undocumented weaknesses.\nThe biggest danger I see with Amazon Sidewalk is not so much what it is now, but what it could become. Amazon could add undesirable features in the future which may go unnoticed by users. Also, if hacked, the service could easily become the new stomping ground for the next IoT botnet.\nThe decision to opt out is a moot point for me. I do not, nor ever intend to, own one of the devices on the list. Take that as a cue.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/amazonsidewalkprivacyconcerns/","summary":"Amazon recently announced the launch of a new service: Amazon Sidewalk which appears to have caused quite a stir.

The article considered whether it is better to use the intrinsic password manager already built-in to your web browser (most web browsers now offer to save your passwords) or to use an extrinsic third-party app like Bitwarden .\nLet\u0026rsquo;s review the arguments he presented in his article and determine if it is safe to use a browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in password manager.\nObjections to third-party Password Managers Travis has clearly spent a lot of time trying to understand the attack surface of popular password managers. He provides a number of objections against using third-party apps and concludes it is better to instead use the one already built into your browser. Below is a summary of his objections:\nIntegrating third-party apps with your web browser adds a level of risk I agree Likewise, syncing data across devices using an untrusted intermediary again adds a level of risk I agree Third-party password managers populate login fields with user credentials which is really tough to do in a secure way I agree Most web browsers use a sandbox security model to protect you while browsing. Browser extensions break this sandbox design Mostly agree Using a third-party password manager requires you to trust the vendor to maintain their infrastructure and keep it safe I agree Travis argues that password managers built-in into your browser provide the same functionality, and can sidestep the fundamental problems with third-party apps highlighted above. Specifically, he suggests that built-in password managers can isolate their trusted UI from websites, they don’t break the sandbox security model, they have world-class security teams, and are very easy to use.\nCounter arguments for using third-party Password Managers While I do not disagree with any of the arguments presented by Travis, there are equally valid reasons why a third-party password manager can still be a good option for many people as detailed below:\nIt is true that the use of a third-party password manager does add an element of risk, however, the same can be said of any browser extension. Unless someone refuses to use any extensions this cannot be used as an argument for not using a third-party password manager. Built-in password managers can restrict a user to using a single browser. However, majority of people do not use a single browser, but instead use multiple browsers across multiple devices or platforms. In fact, compartmentalising activities across different browsers can be a good strategy to improve privacy as discussed here . The use of a third-party password manager does require the trust of an untrusted intermediary, however, to date there has been no evidence to suggest that the most carefully and well-designed 3rd-party password managers have introduced any exploitable vulnerabilities. Password managers are often used to store more than passwords to websites. Many people use the secure notes field to store additional information or store passwords of offline applications. Conclusion Having expounded the arguments presented by Travis Ormandy and also considered some arguments for using a third-party password manager we can now try to answer our original question:\nIs it safe to use a browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in password manager\nIf you use one of the mainstream web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) exclusively then you will be completely safe using its built-in password manager. As Travis points out they isolate your browsing really well and have world-class security teams maintaining them. However, equally, if you use multiple browsers and would like the ability to synchronise data across multiple devices then the most carefully and well-designed 3rd-party password managers are also safe and only introduce a limited element of risk.\nFinally, it would be remiss of me not to mention that we really should be using unique passwords for all our accounts. You don’t have to use a password manager to do that, whatever system works for you is fine. See my previous article for more information.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/browsersbuiltinpasswordmanager/","summary":"I read an interesting article about Password Managers written by Tavis Ormandy, a well known researcher working on Google’s Zero-Day project.

Thankfully this was something the researchers acknowledged themselves and suggested more data from internet-based and social-media platforms are needed to rigorously examine these possibilities.\nSecondly, the results were mixed showing that while technology engagement may be less associated with depression, increased social media has contributed to a rise in other emotional problems. This would appear to be in line with what has been observed anecdotally.\nFinally, the report relied on participants self-reporting their engagement and impact. The disadvantage here is that subjects may not be able to assess themselves accurately or they may submit more socially acceptable answers rather than being truthful. Again, the authors also acknowledged this limitation and suggest in studies of this topic, self-report measures of technology use are consistently biased and are not highly correlated with objective use.\nSo what can we conclude from this study?\nConcerns that technology is becoming both more prevalent in young people’s lives and likewise more harmful to their mental health is not a new issue. Similar concerns were raised about Television use in the late \u0026rsquo;80s and 90s, and although these concerns largely receded, research never conclusively demonstrated that it ceased being harmful or that the fears were not well-founded in the first place.\nI think it is too early to draw any firm conclusions and more research is needed. Does scrolling for hours through filtered photos of other people\u0026rsquo;s perfect lives, at a time when many adolescents are still developing their own identity, have any impact on mental health? I suspect it does; we just need more data to prove it.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/teenstechandmentalhealth/","summary":"The Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford) published the findings of a study this week which investigated the impact of technology on mental health in adolescents.\nThe study investigated engagement with smartphones, social media and television and reported finding little evidence to suggest an increased association between technology use and mental health exists.\nI found these findings somewhat surprising so decided to dig a little deeper.\nFirstly, information about new digital media has only been collected for a relatively short time, therefore, drawing firm conclusions about the impact on mental health at this stage may be premature.","title":"Teens, Tech and Mental Health"},{"content":"This week I listened to the Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. Recorded in 1966 the song uses strong imagery of light and darkness to describe how peoples ignorance and apathy was destroying their ability to communicate with one another. Interestingly, if released today, the lyrics could equally be interpreted to describe how our misuse of some technologies is deeply impacting the very fabric of society. Here is my digital interpretation.\nHello, darkness, my old friend; I\u0026rsquo;ve come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping; left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains, within the sound of silence\nThe opening verse could easily be describing the growing darkness sweeping through our society. We are more connected than at anytime in history. With a swipe of our phone we can connect with a billion people on Facebook, Twitter etc, yet at the same time many people feel more lost, isolated, and lonely than ever before.\nIn restless dreams I walked alone; Narrow streets of cobblestone. \u0026lsquo;Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, that split the night, and touched the sound of silence\nGarfunkel uses imagery here to describe isolation. He saw people communicating on a superficial level, preferring to watch TV rather than engage in deep and meaningful conversations. The imagery appears to be equally at home today. People are slowly loosing the ability to be present in the moment. Checking Facebook for updates when out for a meal, rather than engaging in meaningful conversation with the person across the table. Watching mindless videos on TikTok rather than giving the child in front of them their full attention.\nEvery moment of silence in our lives, be it waiting in a queue, or watching a child\u0026rsquo;s swimming lesson, we break the silence with the neon light of our mobile phones.\nAnd in the naked light I saw, Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking; people hearing without listening. People writing songs that voices never share. No one dared, disturb the sound of silence\nAgain, Garfunkel speaks of superficial communication. He described how there was no serious understanding between people, because there was no deep communication. Equally, today, someone can have 10000 friends on Facebook, yet be lonely, and have no one to turn to in times of trouble. They could \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; to 10000 people on snapchat without ever \u0026lsquo;speaking\u0026rsquo; to them, or \u0026lsquo;hear\u0026rsquo; updates from 10000 people without actually \u0026rsquo;listening\u0026rsquo; to them. And most of what we see on social media is a shadow of real life. No one dares post the bad hair days, break ups, the mundane of daily life, just the highly curated 10% when everything looks wonderful.\nFools, said I, \u0026ldquo;You do not know. Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you; take my arms that I might reach you.\u0026rdquo; But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence\nGarfunkel knew what was happening so they made the first move to reach and teach those around them. Still, despite their efforts, no one listens. They were ignored and people continued with their day-to-day lives asleep, following the crowd. I can certainly relate here. It can be a lonely path trying to raise awareness of these issues. Swimming against the tide can be challenging, but necessary, while these issues grow like a cancer on society.\nAnd the people bowed and prayed, to the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning, in the words that it was forming. And the sign said, \u0026ldquo;The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls, and tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.\u0026rdquo;\nHere, the neon sign refers to technological advancements (TV in his day, mobile phones today). He calls it a god because people were obsessed; idolising the people the saw. The same is true today. Many people are obsessed with their phones and the latest social media celebrity or craze. Teenagers now spend upwards of ten hours on them, withdrawing from real life and real people, replacing them often with superficial digital interactions.\nThe words of the prophets likely referred to armageddon; they were written on the subway walls and tenement halls, because these are places with large volumes of people walking by. Much like people ignored these messages then, people today aren\u0026rsquo;t paying attention to what is happening to society. The very fabric of our society is breaking down. How we share life, communicate and interact with one another is changing, and might I say, not for the better!\nSo that is my digital interpretation of the Simon and Garfunkel classic. It was just a bit of fun so I hope I offend no one, but rather challenge all of us to rethink how we use our technologies.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/soundofsilencedigitalinterpretation/","summary":"This week I listened to the Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

If you are not familiar with the topic, social engineering is the act of abusing human psychology to take advantage of a persons natural tendencies and emotional reactions in order to trick then into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.\nAs part of the series we also explored open source intelligence (OSINT) which is a method often used by hackers to collect information from public sources in order to build a detailed profile about a victim.\nWhile it can be quite concerning to learn how easily hackers can find information about us, the good news is, we can use the same techniques to hunt down our digital footprints and secure or remove old accounts we have forgotten about.\nA good place to start is to search for old social media accounts we have left dormant, with potentially sensitive information, and weak or reused passwords. There are several websites we can use to do this (Whatsmyname , Namecheckup ), the best of which is NameChk which will return a list of all platforms where our specified username has been registered. It is worth noting that some returned results will be false positives, either other peoples accounts (using the same username) or links to accounts that have already been terminated and no longer exist. These can all be ignored.\nOnce you have a list of old accounts which you no longer use, I suggest the following strategy:\nLogin and change the password to a new, strong, unique password stored in your password manager (see article) Download any data you wish to keep e.g. photographs Delete all data from the account, and where possible change the personal information to some kind of alias or pseudonym. This is a grey area, but is generally fine, as long as within the intrinsic nature of the alias there is no false or misleading information, mentioned or implied, meant to defraud someone. Upload some garbage data e.g. random photographs or posts (this step is optional) Finally, leave this account running for a few weeks to allow google to update its servers, and then request to fully delete the account. While this strategy might sound a lot of work, especially if you have a lot of old accounts, it is the best way to remove old footprints and take back control of your online presence.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/reduce-your-digital-footprints/","summary":"This week I have been teaching one of my favourite topics Social Engineering.

As the tool most used to browse the Internet, they can track the sites you visit, how long you spent on them, which links you clicked on or purchases you made, and much more. Choosing the right web browser is, therefore, an important consideration when trying to improve your online privacy.\nIdeally, you should choose a web browser which blocks all trackers by default, or at least, allows you to easily configure it do so. It should also put you in control of your private data, letting you decide the level of information you would like to share with a website. Of course, it should also be fast, and ideally easy to use.\nWith all these requirements it can be difficult to choose the right web browser to use. In this article, I will share some good examples of privacy respecting web browsers you can start to use today.\nBrave The brave browser was introduced in 2016 by Brandon Eich (formerly worked for Mozilla). It is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It’s built on top of Chromium, so will probably feel familiar to current Google Chrome users, making switching fairly easy.\nUnlike Chrome, Brave does not collect data about your online activities, and clearing browsing data is an easy process.\nOut of the box, it has built-in ad, tracker and malware blocking, and can be configured to provide fingerprinting protection (a topic for another post), but essentially makes users appear subtly different to each website.\nFor anyone into Cryptocurrency, Brave incorporates it’s own (BAT tokens), which enables you to anonymously reward the websites you visit most (can be switched off).\nThere have been a few reported issues with the browser, however, these do not appear to have affected user privacy. The main criticism of Brave has been the introduction of it’s own ad program, launched in April 2019. For many, this seems like a strange feature to include, for a browser which prides it’s self on blocking ads.\nLink to Brave browser Ungoogled Chromium Chromium is an open source web browser which enables google tracking by default.\nThe Ungoogled Chromium, as the name suggests, is designed as a drop-in replacement for Chromium, minus the google content. The browser retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible, whilst removing all google tracking features. In addition, it also implements some useful features such as enforcing HTTPS (secure traffic) by default, and forcing all pop ups into tabs.\nUnlike other browsers, such as Brave, Ungoogled Chromium does not have ad and tracking blocking enabled by default, although this can be implemented using extensions and settings.\nAs a web browser, it is not particularly user friendly, and does’t auto update the browser or installed extensions (which is a good thing). This does, however, mean the user has to manually maintain these, making it a better option for advanced users.\nLink to Ungoogled Chromium Irdium The Iridium browser is another secure browser based on the Chromium project, the same project Google Chrome is built on. It is backed by the Open Source Business Alliance, which according to Iridium, has around 190 members.\nSince Iridium is built on Chromium, it provides support for Chrome extensions and receives regular updates and releases. The source code, however, has been modified to respect user privacy.\nThe browser blocks the transmission of partial queries, keywords and metrics to other web services, however, this can be enabled by the user should they wish.\nLink to Iridium browser Firefox The Firefox browser was first introduced in 2002, and is developed by a nonprofit organisation, Mozilla. Currently, it is the third most widely used web browser on the Internet, behind Google’s Chrome (49.3% market share) and Apple’s Safari (31.6%).\nOut of the box, the default privacy settings are not as strong as other browsers (e.g. Brave) , however, Firefox is well known for it’s customisability, making it a popular alternative to Google, Microsoft, and Apple. For example, while Firefox does not automatically block advertisements, there are numerous browser extensions that can be installed to improve security and privacy. Related: DF Tube: How to resist the Blackhole of YouTube\nFirefox does collect some telemetry data, which, they say, is used to improve performance and stability. For example, it will record data about your interactions, such as the number of tabs you open, websites you visit, and plugins you install. In addition, technical data such as the operating system you use, memory etc is also collected. It is, however, an easy task to disable the collection of this data, so be sure to do this as part of the recommended Firefox customisation .\nLink to Firefox browser Tor The Tor browser was developed by the Tor Project in 2002. It’s name is derived from an acronym of the original software project name The Onion Router. When using Tor, your activity and identity are masked, and encrypted in at least three layers (like layers of an onion).\nThe browser is based on Firefox, and uses the Tor network to route your web traffic across the internet. It allows users to access the internet anonymously, since while websites (and your ISP) know that you are connecting through Tor, they cannot identify you. Anonymity is achieved by routing your web traffic around a distributed network of volunteer (thousands) computers, so your path through the internet is effectively hidden. In doing so, your ISP now only knows where you entered the Tor network , not where you exited. Therefore, they cannot identify you when you visit a website on the other end of the communication (when you exit the Tor network).\nOut of the box, Tor is very secure. It does not track your browsing history and will clear your cookies at the end of a session. In addition, the browser includes some builtin protection such as fingerprinting protection.\nThe use of the Tor network can, however, make browsing quite slow (especially streaming). It’s high level of default protection can also break many websites, making them unusable, or littered with endless CAPTCHA verifications. Finally, Tor is often simply blocked by websites, meaning you will not even be able to view them. One way around this is to use the Tor browser with the Tor network disabled, although in this case, it’s probably easierto just use Firefox.\nLink to Tor browser Survey Results While researching the content for this article, I surveyed my mailing list about their password security habits. Here’s what I found.\n86% (+) of people use Google Chrome for web browsing 54% of people say they use the same web browser on all their devices 60% of people sync their data (browsing history, bookmarks etc) across all their devices 53% (+) of people allow their browser to save their passwords for websites they visit 100% of people use a browser which blocks pop-ups or adverts Take aways:\nFrom the results, it’s clear that there is a heavy reliance on Google for online interactions.\nGoogle Chrome is heavily used, with higher usage than the overall market share (49.3%)\nA significant number of people are also syncing data through google’s platform, potentially linking individual activities together (data linkability will be discussed in a future post).\nRecommendations Disclaimer: The advice I am about to share is specifically targeted to subscribers of my mailing list, although it is probably applicable more broadly. I regularly poll my mailing list and respond to their questions regarding their digital habits. If you would like to receive the right advice for you, join the mailing list .\nGeneral Tips: Everyone should consider an alternative to Google Chrome.\nAvoid signing up for new websites with your google account, or even Facebook. Sign up with a separate email address and password (again to reduce data linkability).\nYou do not need to stick to using one web browser. It can be advantageous to group activities and use a different web browser for each (more on this in a future post).\nThere is no perfect web browser, but if you go with one of the above examples you shouldn’t go too wrong.\nRecommended Web Browser Regular browsing/skill level (most people, daily internet browsing)\nChoose a browser that you are comfortable using Choose a browser that supports extensions you may want to use (avoid too many) Choose a browser which offers the best out of the box privacy Use more than one browser as required. I recommend Brave or Firefox (with recommended privacy configuration applied)\nAnonymous browsing/Advanced skill level (browsing you would like to keep anonymous)\nChoose a browser which allows you to customise the settings to your needs. Use multiple browsers as required If using Tor, do not login to your online identities while browsing the web on the same session. Tor doesn’t magically protect you from data you submit to websites. This can still be seen! If using Tor, do not install any plugins or make any customisations. Doing so will could make you stand out from the crowd, and therefore, potentially more traceable.

It is, however, possible to protect your online digital interactions even further, by using Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add extra layers of security when logging into systems.\nMulti-factor Authentication Rather than using a single method of authentication such as a password, multi-factor authentication requires a user to present two or more pieces of evidence (factors) when logging in or using a device or system. The factors most commonly used are knowledge, possession and inherence, simply put: something a user knows (password), something they have (security token), or something they are (biometric e.g. fingerprint or facial recognition).\nThis layered approach to security provides the system with increased confidence that the user requesting access is actually who they claim to be. Plus, security is also increased since it is now more difficult for an unauthorised person to gain access to a target system or device. Even if one factor was compromised (e.g. a password was guessed), the attacker would still need to provide another factor, such as a security token, to gain access.\nCommon factors used for authentication can be broadly grouped into five categories, with the first three below being the most widely used:\nKnowledge: password or answer to a secret question Possession: security token or hardware key Inherence: any biometric trait such as iris, retina, fingerprint, facial recognition, hand geometry or earlobe geometry Location: current location confirmed when logging into system using a smartphone GPS capabilities Time: current time can be used to prevent online fraud. For example, an ATM card couldn’t be used in Scotland, and then 15 minutes later in Canada. Two-factor Authentication (2FA) Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a subset of multi-factor authentication which uses a combination of two different factors to confirm a users identity.\nYou probably use a variation of 2FA daily without even realising it. For example, when you withdraw money from an ATM you are required to provide two pieces of evidence (factors). Something you know (pin number) and something you possess (bank card). Alternatively, you may have used 2FA when you logged into your email account from a new device. If the website does not recognise the device you are using to login, you are often asked to confirm your identity by entering a one-time code, which is sent via text message to your phone. These are both forms of two-factor authentication.\nMany of the online platforms that you use daily, such as Gmail , Facebook , Twitter etc, now offer some form of 2FA, with something you know (password) combined with something you have (e.g. security code), the most common combination used.\nFor each of these services, the something you know, will be your normal password you use to login. The something you have, will normally be a security code which can be commonly generated in three ways (from most secure to least secure):\nHardware Key A hardware key, such as a YubiKey is a small device which plugs into your computer or phone, and is used as a second factor to confirm who you are. When logging into a website, you enter your password as normal, and when prompted simply touch the sensor on the hardware key. The key then sends a code to the website to confirm your identity, and if successful, you are granted access to the website.\nYubikey hardware key supports many platforms such as: AWS, Basecamp, Bitwarden, Blogger, Brave, dropbox, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Facebook, Fastmail, Github, Google, Gov.uk, Instagram, KeePass, LastPass, macOS, Microsoft, Nintendo, ProtonMail, Reddit, SquareSpace, Trello, Twitter, YouTub.\nThe obvious omission from the list is banking. These are probably the online interactions you would like to secure most, however, surprisingly the sector is lagging behind.\nOther examples of hardware keys include OnlyKey .\nSoftware Token A software token uses an app to generate a security code which can be used as a second factor to confirm your identity. When logging into a website you enter your password as normal, and when prompted, enter a six digit code generated by an authentication app such as Authy . The generated code is only valid for a limited time (normally 30 seconds) so during this time window the website checks the code you supplied against the code on the app, and if the code match you are granted access to the website.\nFrom March 2020, regulations were due to force banks to introduce a form of 2FA for every login. However, the timeline for implementation is likely to be delayed due to the current global pandemic. Many banks will likely not opt for software tokens, instead using the least secure method of 2FA: One time passwords (OTP) sent via SMS.\nOther examples include Google Authenticator and FreeOTP (open source).\nSMS Text Some services only support 2FA using SMS text messages which can be used as a second factor to confirm your identity. When logging into a website you enter your password as normal, and when prompted, enter a security code generated by the website, which is sent to your mobile phone via SMS text message. This method of generating a security code is sometimes used as a backup authentication method, should a hardware key or software token be unavailable.\nBiometric Security The third most common factor used for authentication is inherence (something you are). Most mobile phone providers have now implemented some form of biometric security into their devices. However, while fingerprint scanning and facial recognition can provide a convenient, unique and user-friendly way to authenticate users, debate still exits whether they provide a true security enhancement.\nIn terms of pure entropy , biometric security (found in smartphones) can generate stronger security keys than a bad password. However, you leave biometric data everywhere, everyday. It is unique but not secret (like a password). Given enough time, hackers have shown that it is possible to fool authentication systems with faked biometric data, as demonstrated in 2013 when german hacking team (Chaos Computer Club) managed to break Apple’s Touch ID within 24 hours of it being launched. To make matters worse, a hacker may not even need physical access to your device to create a copy of your biometric data. Jan Krissler, known in hacker circles as Starbug, demonstrated how simple close-range photos of a german ministers hand could be used to reverse engineer her fingerprint .\nIn 2017, Apple were applauded for transitioning from fingerprint to facial recognition for user authentication. Indeed, Face ID is among the most secure facial recognition systems available for consumer smartphones. However, Face ID suffers from the same problem as fingerprints, your face is not secret. Your iPhone is not the only device that can scan your face, hundreds of cameras do it everyday without your consent. In 2018, Taylor Swift used this to her advantage to identify a stalker. She setup a video kiosk and showed video footage of her rehearsals to fans at her concert. While unknowing fans watched the video, facial recognition was used to cross reference their faces with a database of known stalkers, and identify her stalker. Since then, hackers and researchers have also now managed to bypass Apple’s Face ID by creating copies of biometric data that was ‘good enough’ to fool the system.\nIt is safe to say, that in the age of social media and surveillance cameras, your face is virtually everywhere and stored in data centres across the globe. Hopefully, your biometric data is safe, however, biometric data breaches have already been reported involving banks, UK Police and defence firms . Airlines have also been targeted, since they collect a lot of biometric data, and are seen as soft targets. While data breaches are not just an issue for biometrics, with passwords also being commonly leaked, there is a big difference. If a password to one of your accounts is compromised, you can simply create a new one and update your account. By contrast, once your biometric data is compromised it effects all your accounts at once, and could have serious repercussions for the rest of your life.\nFor now, while enterprise level biometric systems can improve corporate security, consumer grade biometric authentication is more of a convenience measure than a security enhancement, something german hacker, Frank Rieger believes:\nIt is plain stupid to use something that you can´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token - Frank Rieger (CCC)\nRecommendations Disclaimer: The advice I am about to share is specifically targeted to subscribers of my mailing list, although it is probably applicable more broadly. I regularly poll my mailing list and respond to their questions regarding their digital habits. If you would like to receive the right advice for you, join the mailing list .\nGeneral Tips: Implement 2FA in conjunction with using a Password Manager for all your online interactions Use the most secure method of two-factor authentication available for each online interaction SMS text message should be avoided as the main method of 2FA, since codes will not be encrypted. Use SMS 2FA only when a hardware key or software token are not supported. Have a backup method in case you loose access to an account which is setup to use 2FA. Most services that allow 2FA will provide you with some OTP (one time passwords) when you setup your account with 2fa. For example, Protonmail will give you ten OTP which you can use once, if you are not be able to log in due to a lost hardware key or non functioning authentication app. It is advisable to store these OTP securely, in either the notes field of your Password Manager or on your local hard drive inside an encrypted folder. Use biometric authentication only if you must, and use it cautiously. Regular risk/skill level (most people): use a software token generated by an app\nIt will provide a second authentication method which is secure and convenient. Will synchronise across your devices (PC \\ Mobile \\ Tablet). I recommend Authy . While it isn’t open source, the risk to privacy is fairly low. The only data being synced online is random security keys not personal data.\nIncreased risk/Advanced skill level: use a hardware key where possible and an open source software token when needed\nA hardware key will provide the most secure 2FA, although will require more effort to setup This option is going to be less convenient, especially if you are not at your main computer. Many websites do not support hardware keys, so a software token will also be required. No syncing across devices so your data is not stored online. I recommend YubiKey and FreeOTP or AndOTP . Both software tokens are open source and a little fiddly to setup, but provide the best alternative to a hardware key.\nImplementing 2FA in conjunction with using a Password Manager for all your online interactions, is going to drastically improve your digital security.\nUsing multi-factor authentication contributes to the ‘Protect‘ strategy of my Digital Balance philosophy, which encourages us to:\nrefine our digital interactions so they continue to support the goals and activities we want to pursue but minimise our exposure to risk and unhealthy relationships with technology\nTo learn more about the philosophy , and how you can apply the three strategies Compartmentalise, Protect, and Refine to achieve the right balance in your digital interactions, download a copy of my free ebook .\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/multi-factor-authentication-2fa-and-biometrics/","summary":"In a recent article, How to create and manage strong passwords, I demonstrated how using mnemonics to remember complex passwords or adopting a bitwarden can be used to improve your digital security, and make you a much more difficult target for potential hackers.

Depending on which study you read, the average person has 27 online accounts and between 70-80 passwords to remember. As a result, many people choose the path of least resistance (I’m working on a future post about this) so either use simple, easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or use the same password everywhere.\nCreating and managing strong passwords may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t need to be, and I’m going to show you how.\nBrief history of Passwords Before we look at how to create strong passwords, for fun, let’s look at a brief history of their use. The use of passwords is often traced back to the 1960’s when Fernando Corbató, working at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), created a way for researchers to share a common mainframe, but keep their individual files private. The concept of a password was developed so that users could only access their own specific files for their allotted four hours a week (if my children are reading this – see even they had time restrictions on their technology use).\nHowever, the notion of passwords can be traced back even further. The literary history of the password dates back to the 18th century classic tale of Ali Baba and the forty thieves, where “Open, Sesame” was used as a password to gain access to magical sealed cave. Not surprisingly, “open sesame” often appears in lists of the most commonly used passwords! Don’t use it!\nIn 16th century renaissance Italy cardinals are believed to have used ciphers to protect their correspondence. There is also historical evidence of the Roman military reportedly using passwords as a way to distinguish friend from foe.\nFinally, many of you may be familiar with Shibboleth, a system which let’s you use a single set of credentials to log into multiple systems that are linked together as a federation (Universities and colleges use this called Eduroam). Interestingly, the name is derived from the Shibboleth Incident which took place in the 11th century. The 12th chapter of the biblical Book of Judges records a battle between the tribes of Gilead and Ephraim. Gileadite soldiers used the word “shibboleth” as a password, and a way to detect their enemies, knowing that the Ephraimites were not able to pronounce “sh” in their dialect. Knowing the password was literally life or death!\nClearly, passwords have been around for a long time. They may not have much of a future, but that is a topic for another post.\nStrategies for creating secure passwords The original advice when creating passwords was to choose one that someone couldn’t guess. However, very soon long lists of the most popular passwords were shared online leaving these passwords vulnerable to dictionary attacks (I’m working on a future post about this). To mitigate this risk the advice was updated so that passwords should now be at least eight characters in length, made up of letters, at least one number and a symbol such as (@#$%{}/\\'”~,;:.\u0026lt;\u0026gt;+-=_^?\u0026amp;*!|). While this advice can help produce more secure passwords, they are very hard to remember. So how can you create a secure password that you can remember? Well, here are a few strategies you can try:\nMethod 1: Mnemonics (acronyms or phrases that are easy to remember) Convert a sentence into a password Bruce Schneier, a security expert, recommends turning a sentence into a password. The sentence should be personal and memorable to you, but not to anyone else e.g. not the lyrics of a popular song. Take the words from the sentence, apply some personal memorable tricks to modify that sentence into a long-length secure password. For example,\nWow…doestfsd = Wow, does that flower smell delightful.\nLtime@go-ihtow@lkh4\u0026gt;5m! = Long time ago i had to walk home for more than 5 miles\nThis strategy should produce a seemingly random long password, but one which is difficult to crack, and importantly easy for you to remember.\nPass Phrases An alternative to creating strings of characters as a password is to use a pass phrase. Popularised by the xkcd comic the logic behind this strategy is that a password made up of random characters, such as Cj0ue4\u0026amp;3pex, is hard for humans to remember but easy for password cracking software. Whereas, a passphrase such as Treewrongmonkeygrapefruit is easier for humans to remember, but difficult for a computer to guess.\nThe key to this method is the length (number of words) and the randomness. It essentially uses the concept of diceware to select words (six now recommended) at random from a special list called a Diceware Word List.\nIt is best to avoid choosing the random words ourselves as we risk selecting words that are either linked due to cognitive bias in our brains or using words that we may have posted publicly (e.g. on social media). Both of which can result in weak passwords since they can create a surface area of predictability an attacker can leverage, or could leave the password susceptible to a dictionary attack.\nThe general advice when creating pass phrases is to use:\na minimum of 6 base words (the more the better) a decent size word list. Diceware’s recommendation of 6^5 (7776) should be used randomly selected words (Do not pick them yourself) include spaces in your passwords if you want PAO (Person-Action-Object) Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University put forward the PAO method to create and store your unbreakable passwords. The theory behind the method is that our brains have cognitive advantages for memorisation when using visual cues and memorable stories.\nTo use the method you use a combination of a person using an interesting object to do something (the stranger the better). For example, Kermit the frog eating haggis. To extend this further and make an even more secure random pass phrase the researchers suggest you picture a setting in which the person-action-object story is occurring. Let’s say that the setting is a secret pink bunker. You now end up with a sentence like “Kermit the frog eating haggis at a pink underground bunker. The point of this mnemonic technique is that you end up with six words Kermit, eating, haggis, pink, underground, bunker that according to kasperky will take 10000+ centuries for an average home computer to bruteforce. It can be made even harder to crack by replacing some letters with numbers, punctuation or special characters.\nThere are lot’s of other examples such as Phonetic muscle memory, but the three above strategies offer good protection, and importantly, produce passwords that are easy to remember.\nMethod 2: Password Card A completely different approach to remembering your passwords is to to use a Password Card. These are credit card sized cards which you print, keep in your wallet, and use to create secure passwords, without having to remember them.\nPassword Card The card has a unique grid of random letters and digits, each row with a different colour and each column a different symbol. Rather than remembering a strong password for each site you use, you simply remember a combination of a symbol and colour (e.g. ! green), and then read the letters and digits off the card (e.g. Q5F5pZGMP). You can mix things up by choosing any length and direction. For example, when using ! green you could read left for five characters and then down for four (e.g. Qr8jwkCF9). Just remember the pattern you use, and I suggest using the same pattern for all passwords.\nI know I will probably get some kick back for advocating the use of Password cards, with the two main objections being:\nWe’ve always been advised not to write down our passwords. What if my wallet gets stolen However, while I agree in general that writing down passwords is probably not the best idea, the logic here is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. It’s far safer to pick secure passwords and write them down (obviously stored securely), than it is to remember simple and easy to guess passwords. Bruce Schneier would certainly agree, as he recommends writing some passwords down. I am not quite at that place, but in this case I see no problem as you are not actually writing any passwords down, only a grid for creating the passwords. Sure, your wallet could get stolen, but the thief will not actually know your passwords, only the grid of random digits from which you created it. There are simply too many possible passwords on the card for them to bother trying to figure out the password of an average user. As with any password method, just be careful and watch out for shoulder surfers.\nMethod 3: Use a Password manager The final option is using a password manager, such as LastPass, to create and store long secure passwords. The password manager is secured with a master password which you remember and can then be used to store every other online password you need to remember. Most password managers come with an easy to use web interface, and many also includes plugins for various web browsers and apps for many smartphones. More on password managers later.\nSurvey Results While researching the content for this article, I surveyed my mailing list about their password security habits. Here’s what I found.\nOver 60% of people either remember or write down their password. It was good that nearly 40% of people use a password manager, however, I suspect at present I have a disproportionate number of highly technical users in my mailing list. I suspect a more reflective figure would be closer to what was found here. 96% of people reuse their passwords, or part of, on multiple sites. The largest percentage of people (33%) use a mixture of text (upper and lowercase), numbers and special characters. I suspect this reflects enforcement by password policies, which is good. 81% of people use a password between 8-15 characters (again probably as they are forced to). However, I suspect it may be common that an old password has something appended to the end of it to make it up to 8 characters e.g ‘billydog’ + ‘1234’ Over 50% of people just add something to the end of the an old password when forced to change it. It was good that only 5% choose something easy to remember like a family name. Take aways:\nPassword recycling is the most common problem, and poses the biggest risk.\nThe vast majority of people admit to doing it. Large percentage of people still try to remember their passwords, however, the average person can only remember 4 or 5 secure and complex passwords (unless using some of the strategies above). It is very common to simply add something to the end of an old password, meaning part of the password is still reused.

I regularly poll my mailing list and respond to their questions regarding their digital habits. If you would like to receive the right advice for you, join the mailing list. This advice also contributes towards the Protect strategy of my Digital Balance Philosophy which proposes we should:\nrefine our digital interactions so they continue to support the goals and activities we want to pursue but minimise our exposure to risk and unhealthy relationships with technology - Christoper D. McDermott\n# General Tips:\nEvery password should be complex, and importantly unique (not reused on another site) and preferably randomly generated. To achieve this, everyone should be using a password manager (see below) to store a secure unique password for every site you use online. Your aim is not to know any of your passwords for online accounts. However, you may still need to remember a few secure passwords, for example the master password for your password manager (used to open the application) therefore I recommend using one of the strategies I listed above. For example, you could use a Password Card to create a secure password to get into your password manager, and then use the password manager to store every other password for you. When changing passwords do not use a public computer or wifi. Instead, use a clean computer on your home wifi network. The last tip is a little controversial. You do not need to change all your passwords on a regular basis. Forcing people to do so can actually do more harm than good because people resort to the habits I mentioned in the introduction. If you are using the above tips you passwords should be safe and secure, therefore only change them if you suspect an account has been compromised. Recommended Password Managers Regular risk/skill level (most people) – use an online password manager It will generate secure passwords for you Store them securely so even you and even the company do not know them. It will synchronise your passwords across devices (PC \\ Mobile \\ Tablet) Has a browser extension so it can populate username and password fields when you visit the genuine website for each password I recommend Bitwarden. It is open source and has an active community.\nIncreased risk/Advanced skill level – use an offline password manager It will also generate secure passwords for you Will store your passwords securely so even you do not know it. You will need to install it manually on each of your devices (no syncing), but it means none of your data is stored or synced online. Has a browser extension so it can populate username and password fields when you visit the genuine website for each password Ultimately, this option is going to be less convenient (especially if you are not on your main computer) but more secure. I recommend KeePass XC. Again it is open source and has an active community.\nUsing secure passwords contributes to the ‘Protect‘ strategy of my Digital Balance philosophy, which encourages us to:\nrefine our digital interactions so they continue to support the goals and activities we want to pursue but minimise our exposure to risk and unhealthy relationships with technology\nTo learn more about the philosophy, and how you can apply the three strategies Compartmentalise, Protect, and Refine to achieve the right balance in your digital interactions, download a copy of my free ebook.\nDF Tube ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/how-to-create-and-manage-strong-passwords/","summary":"We all know we should use secure passwords, but, how do you balance the necessity of highly secure passwords with the ability to easily recall them when needed?

Many advertisers and sponsors have suspended advertising on Facebook, and some big names have left twitter (they were banned to be fair) moving to it’s “anything goes” rival paler. What better week to share a review of Christopher Wylie’s book: Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica’s Plot to Break the World.\nLast week as I sat down to write a review I came across a great video on YouTube by Dan White , who kindly offered to share his review with subscribers of my mailing list (join the list to hear everything first). Dan provides unique and thought provoking book reviews and discussion. Enjoy the review.\nBook review The Book That Almost Made We Want to Delete Facebook\nFacebook has become something of a monster in modern day society; what first started as a website for college students has fast become the most popular online space on the planet, with people of all ages posting content from all over the world, and although Facebook’s aim is to connect people and families there is a great deal more happening across the platform. Opinions are posted, stories are shared, and there’s no real way to filter any of it, some may argue it would be pointless to try and control this information, but can Facebook really be left alone? Couple this with the mass amounts of data the company holds on people, and you have a website in a great position of power, with next to no regulation and only arbitrary rules regarding what should and should not be posted, but Facebook is certainly not immune to scandals and no more is this made apparent in Christopher Wylie’s, Mindf*ck — a book with an outlandish title, and one hell of a story regarding the abuse of personal data.\nFacebook is like the habit you can’t kick. You try to remove it from your life and suddenly you may notice you’ve lost access to lots of other sites, that’s mainly because details on Facebook are actively used to sign up to websites so we can avoid the whole boring process of inputting personal data, take that way and it’s goodbye to those accounts — it’s like facing withdrawal. Let Facebook take control and you can sign up to a website in no time at all, but take away Facebook and suddenly you’ve lost the majority of access. Take Facebook away and suddenly you feel a little disconnected with the world, as if everyone is having a big party that you’re not invited to. Of course that’s an exaggeration, but with the world on Facebook, getting rid of it can make you feel isolated even if the reality is false.\nI’m sure you noticed in the title for this very book review, I stated that this book made me want to delete Facebook from my life, and let me assure you that statement is true. I’ve been thinking about taking the plunge (as it were) for some time, and it still remains the case. For too long I’ve questioned the continued uses of Facebook in a time where it feels so powerful, imposing and in a great sense, unnecessary, at least on the surface. With past data being thrown around willy nilly, one has to ask what such a monopoly corporation is doing with it all. But as you may know, leaving a website that has its arms stretching out in all directions is no easy thing. For to solely walk out on Facebook in these modern times, that puts a wall up too many, many people, and no matter how much we may not like it, or even wish to believe it, with the world on Facebook, one person leaving is at a big disadvantage, particularly in the digital world. I’m making the point that Facebook is powerful, people rarely give it up, people rarely think about what Facebook is even doing, and for those who do go offline for good, certain connections taper off. Now with such power should come supervision, regulation, but in the view of Facebook this is far from the case. It is a business unique in its position, and so maybe after this book review you too, may feel a little less comfortable when scrolling through that infinite feed of content tailored. Just. For. You.\nAuthor Christopher Wylie speaks of his difficulty growing up in a world not quite to his own mould. When younger he was treated differently, and felt a stranger to others for the fact he used a wheelchair to get around. He states it was this alienation that drove him to computers. Like most who excel in coding and computer sciences Wylie spent most of his younger years in front of a screen, this later developing him the skills needed to create a system of mass data harvesting and from such, the manipulation that followed. His later interest in politics combined with his keep aptitude for data landed him various jobs, including a brief stint with the Liberal Democrats party in the UK. Wylie finds himself working for a company called SCL and later a subsidiary known as Cambridge Analytica. It is here where he works on data harvesting products for various clients, and explains to the reader exactly what that means. No doubt you’ve heard of Cambridge Analytica, but no one really seems to know exactly what was going on between Facebook and this little known company, at least not in a concise understanding. There’s a reason Christopher Wylie is now permanently banned from Facebook.\nIn an age of nuclear bombs, tanks, fighter jets and god knows how many other war machines on this planet, you may wonder why the hell data is so important, and furthermore why it is important to people in countries of war and to people in countries of peace. That right there is what this book does a brilliant job of explaining, for it’s not the data itself that is important, it’s what people, and corporations do with it. In particular Cambridge Analytica went above and beyond the ways it harvested and used data for the benefits of it’s own investors, and interests. But why oh why is data so important I hear you ask? Some people may assume that scammers and wannabe criminals are the biggest threats, but that is far from the case. Let’s start first with how Cambridge Analytica even managed to get all that data in the first place. Well here my friends is the kicker, and one reason alone as to why you should read this book.\nNot long ago at all, Facebook was able to share data without your consent, whenever you used a specific app that had been designed on the platform. And it gets worse than that. Imagine you never even used one of these apps. Let’s say you have a friend called James. Say James used that app, well Facebook would not only pull the data from James’ profile and send it to the app developers, but from every single one of his friend’s profiles, and if you’re his friend, then tough luck, because your data has been banked and shipped off for whatever use fits the purpose. And it doesn’t take a genius to work out that the data you input into Facebook is of a deeply personal nature, in some cases it could be used to identify you to a higher degree of accuracy than even your own parents. This is the world we find ourselves living in Christopher Wylie’s book, and the awful fact of the matter is that this book is not a fictional story. It is an account from a real person, who first hand saw these abuses and passed evidence on to prove it.\nWith such mass data Cambridge Analytica began consulting with psychology professors and put together personality profiles that would identify people with specific personality traits. They would then release their digital arsenal and target these people in an effort to sway opinion. They expertly crafted fake news, false stories, communities, adverts, videos and targeted people across the globe to sway popular opinion of leaders, corporations or whoever was the highest bidder. With millions upon millions of data Cambridge analytica could fabricate a society and tweak it as they please. The implications are shocking, and this book goes on to take this notion of data manipulation further as to say that both the US Presidential election and Brexit vote were manipulated by the hand of Cambridge Analytica, feeding people false stories, sometimes subtle, other times not, and swaying there vote in a method far more effective than a simple leaflet through a letter box. And it is for this reason Wylie felt he had to tell this tale.\nConclusions Bold claims from a bold book, that I certainly enjoyed reading, despite in parts how often unnerving it is. I must warn, there are some shocking statements within these pages, and ones that certainly warrant further investigation, but what this book does so well is explain the shocking ways in which your data can be used to create a virtual space in where you live. This space can be tweaked, can be bombarded with content to influence your decisions through psychological profiling. Articles are recommended to you that either support your points or perhaps seek to weaken them. And that’s scary, because how many times are you recommended something in a day? And how many times did you ask for it? Your virtual life and the content provided is churned out through a dozen algorithms and you may never know who or what is controlling them. And that there is the sickly horror of this tale.\nSo while we can all moan about Facebook and blissfully disregard the notion of data harvesting as boring and irrelevant, perhaps even the whole debate about regulation, upon reading this book it becomes abundantly clear that such topics are of the utmost importance. Ignorance is bliss until you realise you’ve been manipulated by more than just an advert displaying some clothes you quite fancy buying. People would not so easily pass the keys to their house around the local bar, but seem to be perfectly fine inputting all their information online perhaps because they assume it’s in good hands, but behind the scenes it’s been used to drum up fear and hatred for whatever cause has the highest bidder, and so this book plays out as more a work of horror than a piece of nonfiction, and how sad that is to type… Next time you’re told to sign up to any old thing, with details saved in any old place, stop and think exactly what it is you are revealing and to what you are giving, because I can certainly imagine you would never write a letter with a sizeable chunk of information, stamp your address, and post it off to a company perching on Mayfair, yet as time has passed little to nothing has changed online. Some people got a slap on the wrist but the machine keeps turning, and odds are, we’re all part of the oil that keeps it running.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/minfckinsidecambridgeanalyticasplottobreaktheworld/","summary":"Introduction It seems an appropriate week to be talking about social media.

Who doesn’t like to watch cats and babies doing funny things, or learn how to replace a door catch on your dishwater to avoid an expensive plumbers bill. But, if you impulsively watch more and more videos and compulsively log in more frequently, even when you had planned to do something more productive, you may be addicted. In this article I will share some tips on how to avoid the black hole of YouTube using, amongst other things, DF Tube a plugin for Firefox.\nTips If this sounds familiar, do not worry, you not alone. With a little bit of willpower, and a clear strategy, you can overcome this issue and return to using the technology in a happy and healthy manner. You will need to find the right strategy for you, but here are some tips to try:\nSchedule a specific time of day, say 6-7pm when you are allowed to use the platform. Do not be tempted to extend this time. Having a strict limit will force you to be more selective in the content you watch. Remove the YouTube app from your phone. When trying to break a habit it is useful to add some friction, in order to make the activity more difficult to do. Removing the app from your phone means whenever you are bored, stood in a queue or waiting for a bus, you will not be tempted to watch a few sneaky videos. Now the only time you can watch a video is when you are sat in front of your computer, where you can monitor your time more easily. The added benefit is that you might find yourself talking to more people or reading an educational or entertaining book. Unsubscribe from any channels you may be following, and only add a few carefully selected channels back in, which you really enjoy or add value to your life. Install a Distraction blocking plug-in for your web browser. For Google Chrome (In the future I am going to show you why should move away from Chrome) there a several good options, one being DF Tube or for Firefox you could try DF Tube . These plug-in allow you to watch your chosen videos, but remove all the distractions from the side bars which YouTube uses to entice you to spend more time on the platform. Remember, the business model of YouTube (and most social media platforms for that matter) is to keep you hooked on their platform for as long as possible. Clicking links, watching more videos, leaving comments ultimately creates more revenue for them. Using these tips and a little willpower, you should now be able to enjoy YouTube in a happier and healthier way. You still get to watch all your great videos, but hopefully you can now be more intentional in the way you use the platform, and don’t fall into the trap of loosing hours of time clicking on random videos you never intended to watch in the first place.\nInstallation guide For a quick guide on how to install the Chrome version, follow the Video below which I found on YouTube (see I still think YouTube is awesome), in which the guy does a great job showing you how to get started.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/dftube-how-to-watch-youtube-distraction-free/","summary":"YouTube is awesome.

I started my Blog and mailing list . It’s something I have been thinking about doing for a while, but always managed to find an excuse not to start, sound familiar ? This got me thinking about a quote I recently heard by Stoic philosopher, Epictetus:\nIf you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid - Epictetus\nI think his point is that often the fear of looking foolish can cripple us and prevent us from starting a new venture or applying for a dream job or starting a blog. If we are not careful we can place too much importance on social validation and caring what other people think. Of course, it’s good to value other people’s opinions, using these to guide and keep us accountable for our actions. But, when this need is out of balance we can loose authenticity and succumb to fear. So how can we avoid this trap ?\nAt the risk of sounding harsh, remember that everyone is far too busy worrying about their own lives, and what others think about them, to even remotely care about what we are doing. If, as Epictetus says, we are content to be thought foolish, the ‘fear of what others think’ will no longer be a stumbling block. I raise the second point, in particular, for a reason. While I have been considering how we use technology and the impact of social media, I think this point is at the centre of how we can choose to use technology healthily. The fear of what others think can manifest itself as a form of hidden self inflicted censorship where we are sometimes scared to share out real thoughts on a subject, and rather choose to comply with the ‘herd mentality’. In addition, the need for social validation can lead to a dangerous position where our inner self-worth is governed by what others think of us. A point professional sport climber, Madison Fischer eloquently raised on her blog saying:\nI wanted the congratulations. I wanted admiration. I wanted my follower count to grow. I wanted everyone to envy my life and achievements. I wanted, no, needed people to tell me I was going places - Madison Fischer\nIf we are not careful the need for others to validate our self worth, and the fear of what they may think about us, can lead us to craft highly curated artificial lives online. Only showing the good parts, portraying a life that is neither authentic or reflective of who we really are. If this was not bad enough, it can lead others to desire our artificial life, lead them to question the value of their own, ultimately reducing their own belief of self worth. A harmful cycle on a downward trajectory. Cal newport raises the deeper question lurking beneath this debate, and one that I will also leave us all to consider:\nAre these services making you a better or worse version of yourself ?\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/our-need-for-validation-through-social-media/","summary":"So last week I took the plunge.

In doing so, it joins a host of other countries (including Germany, Italy and Denmark) to favour a decentralised system developed by the Silicon Valley giants, rather than a centralised model developed locally. A step in the right direction ?\nThere has been much debate and concern about the need and function of contact tracing apps to fight the current global pandemic. Indeed, the Ada Lovelace Institute has previously questioned whether any such system was needed and would be safe, fair and equitable stating:\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of digital contact tracing as an effective technology to support the pandemic response - Ada Lovelace Institute\nOther points of note from their rapid evidence review highlight that effective deployment of technology to support the transition from the crisis will be contingent on public trust and confidence. Also, that legislation should be advanced to regulate data processing to impose strict purpose, access and time limitations. Finally, until a robust and credible means of immunity testing is developed, focus should be on considering the deep societal implications of any immunity certification regime, rather than on developing digital immunity certificates.\nThe debate continued when a number of leading scientists and researchers in the field of security and privacy also raised concerns about the original plans of NHSX to deploy a contact tracing application. They produced a joint statement raising concerns about the proposal to record centrally the de-anonymised IDs of infected people and also the IDs of all those with whom the infected person has been in contact. They highlighted that the facility could (via mission creep) lead to a form of future surveillance unless the usual data protection principle is applied: collect the minimum data necessary to achieve the objective of the application.\nWe hold it is vital that if you are to build the necessary trust in the application the level of data being collected is justified publicly by the public health teams demonstrating why this is truly necessary rather than simply the easiest way, or a “nice to have”, given the dangers involved and invasive nature of the technology\nFinally, they sought assurance from the NHSX regarding how it planned to phase out the application after the pandemic has passed to prevent mission creep.\nThis joint statement came hot on the heels of a previous wider joint statement by a group of international scientists and researchers who raised similar concerns and provided a set of principles which they feel should be followed, namely:\nContact tracing Apps must only be used to support public health measures for the containment of COVID-19. The system must not be capable of collecting, processing, or transmitting any more data than what is necessary to achieve this purpose. Any considered solution must be fully transparent. The protocols and their implementations, including any sub-components provided by companies, must be available for public analysis. The processed data and if, how, where, and for how long they are stored must be documented unambiguously. Such data collected should be minimal for the given purpose. When multiple possible options to implement a certain component or functionality of the app exist, then the most privacy-preserving option must be chosen. Deviations from this principle are only permissible if this is necessary to achieve the purpose of the app more effectively, and must be clearly justified with sunset provisions. The use of contact tracing Apps and the systems that support them must be voluntary, used with the explicit consent of the user and the systems must be designed to be able to be switched off, and all data deleted, when the current crisis is over. They urged all countries to respect users’ privacy by relying only on systems that are subject to public scrutiny and that are design specifically with privacy in mind (instead of there being an expectation that they will be managed by a trustworthy party), as a means to ensure that the data protection rights are upheld\nCritical thinking around this subject is required and the principle guidelines outlined by my scientific brethren is probably a good place to start.\nWhat do you think ? Do you agree with Matt Hancock that engaging in Test and Trace is our civic duty or do you lean more towards the Canadian approach of being completely voluntary ?\nLet me know by join my mailing and contributing to the discussion.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/articles/the-debate-about-contact-tracing-apps/","summary":"It appears the UK government have decided to scrap their NHS contact tracing app in favour of a model based on Google and Apple’s technology.

However, interestingly according to Forbes during this time, many of the same companies responsible for powering the recent decade-long bull market have gained even more clout, with tech behemoths Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft now accounting for over 22% of the S\u0026amp;P. That’s up from a 15 % share in 2018. To put that into perspective, according to New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo…\nThe “frightful five” — Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook — are collectively more powerful than many governments - Farhad Manjoo\nThis pandemic is arguably the largest crisis of our generation, but even with a great deal of uncertainty around our ability to get out of this, it looks like big tech firms may come out of this even stronger. According to NYU professor Scott Galloway the likes of Google and Amazon could gain more power by tightening their grip on the supply chain and e-commerce, with a hundred billion dollars of grocery shopping moving online to tech giants such as Walmart or Amazon. This is obviously great news for shareholders, but not for small companies struggling to survive, furloughing or laying off staff to reduce costs. And while this corporate culling takes place, the likes of Walmart and Amazon continue to consolidate the marketplace, buying up small companies on the cheap to increase their ever expanding empire.\nMake no mistake, the big tech companies, like google, have enough cash on hand to survive the pandemic. They could, should they wish, buy the likes of Boeing and Airbus. Let that sink in for a minute ! Indeed, the trend is evident already with Facebook buying Giphy and investing in geo marketing, while many high street stores go into administration.\nSo what does a post covid-19 look like ? Well, the truth is many of these big tech companies were arguably already too powerful before the pandemic hit. They were often criticised for stifling innovation, avoiding taxes and not being held accountable when their platforms are weaponised, even when it threatens democracy. In post covid-19, when a culling of the corporate herd has taken place, there will be less companies competing for the same number of customers. Less competition is never good for citizens or the economy, especially when the few already yield so much influence and power over our lives.

Perhaps, like me you only recently heard the term and let out a slight groan, conflating the idea with the wider, more popular trending philosophy of Minimalism, in which people live a life with less stuff (I’m minimalising the philosophy there).\nLet me clear, I like the idea of Minimalism. I have even tried to adopt some principles in my life, although all attempts have ended in failure as we are a family of hoarders. Note to self…. I must return to explore the philosophy. In addition, let me also state, I am huge advocate for technology, I teach it every day in my day job. However, I now see both sides of the equation, and want to help us be more intentional in the way we use it.\nDigital Minimalism\nBack to the Digital version of the philosophy. I first learned about this area after hearing an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science Professor who also writes about deep work and intentional living. After reading his book: Digital Minimalism on the topic, I now understand the thinking behind it, and see the value in the philosophy. If nothing else, it is worth some thought and consideration.\nThe justification for the philosophy is that technology has permeated into every facet of our lives. Many times (as is the case with Social Media) the technology is designed to maximise our attention and interactions, which can often lead to the manipulation and monetisation of our thoughts and values by large tech companies. In addition, technology addiction, our obsessive phone checking, and validation from social media platforms is becoming an increasing problem in society.\nStood in the queue at Tesco …. flip the phone out rather than talk to someone.\nWaiting at the bus stop …. fill the gap with mindless information on our phone.\nOut on a date …. check-in on Facebook to tell everyone what your doing, rather than enjoying the moment.\nDigital Minimalism is a call to discover a different way of approaching technology. Newport defines it as a philosophy in which you:\nfocus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else - Cal Newport\nIt is founded in the belief that less is more (borrowed from its parent Minimalism philosophy) when it comes to new digital tools. That a carefully curated list of technologies can provide value to your life, but beyond this many are simply a distraction, which consume vast qualities of your time and limit more meaningful actions and interactions with others.\nIf your phone usage, Facebook scrolling, or Twitter addiction has ever caused you concern, then my hope with this blog is to help you recognise and start a new journey and relationship with technology. In particular with our phones. For example, would a better use of your time be to meet a friend for coffee once a month or call a relative for a half-hour each week, than spending that time observing their posted photos and clicking ‘like’ as a means of staying in touch?\nIf you believe so, join me on this journey and share your experience and tips.

Specifically, how attackers use methods of psychological manipulation to coerce humans into making errors. I seek to understand and manage psychological vulnerabilities, and develop technologies and controls that are designed with human behaviour in mind.\nExploitation of human psychology: I am interested in exploring the mismatch between our natural human sensitivities and the exponential growth, power and influence of technology. I seek to explore the persuasive nature of technology and how it can exploit psychological vulnerabilities to shape attitudes and behaviour. Specifically, the growing paradox that exists between our desire for privacy and lack of privacy-preserving behaviour when interacting on the Internet. Also, the breakdown of truth online (Fake news and misinformation) and identification of trustworthy content.\nOverdependence on technology: Technology has permeated into every area of our lives. However, a severe over reliance, or an addiction to certain facets of its use, can have devastating effects on our health. While technology can fulfil our natural human need for stimulation and interaction, it can also impact the pleasure systems of the brain, replace activities which make us human and be used as an escape from reality. I seek to explore ways to be more intentional with our use of technology, using it to support our goals and values, rather than letting it use us.\nWhat I am working on now I am currently exploring the issues highlighted above and assimilating these into an appropriate theory and framework of strategies.\nMy aim is to help us optimise our use of technology such that all our digital interactions are safe, healthy and support the values and ambitions we each hold.\nSee more here: philosophy\nPersonal Information Chris McDermott\u0026rsquo;s birthday is August 16, 1975.

You can sign up here In only a short space of time it has grown in popularity, with many readers saying it has really encouraged them to explore how to get a happier, healthier, and more productive relationship with technology.\nEach week I send out a small exclusive email to subscribers. In this, I share some thoughts about subjects I’ve been pondering, along with tips on how to use technology better, and how to stay safe while maintaining your privacy online.\nIn any given Musing you might find a link to a thought provoking podcast interview or a book I think you will find interesting and challenging. Be warned, some of my musings may challenge you to rethink things you have taken for granted, often resulting in lively and topical debate with subscribers. This, however, is fantastic, as it will give you an opportunity to ‘think out loud’.\nI am particularly interested in exploring the influence of technology on our lives, and how we can take back control. We all have unique experiences and can learn from one another. Therefore, I encourage everyone to contribute to the debate.\nWhat else can you expect from a Musing? Who knows, I’m interested in a lot of stuff! If you want to see a few samples, you can see them here.\nMake sure you sign up to get the next musing!

The Internet has brought about some fantastic innovations, however, in some cases technologies that were meant to liberate us have in fact exploited areas of human psychology, leaving many of us addicted to our phones, endlessly checking social media feeds, and comparing ourselves against the carefully curated digital versions of the people we follow.\nIn addition, privacy is severely under threat as tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder. The profits of their social media platforms depends not only on predicting our behaviour but in some cases modifying it too ( read my book review to learn more ).\nThe good news is we can still turn this ship around. Technology is not inherently evil, and with the right philosophy it can provide value and enrich our lives. It’s still possible to reap the benefits and rewards of the technologies we use, but in a safe and healthy manner.\nTo implement my philosophy I recommend a three part strategy in which you optimise your use of technology to ensure that all your digital interactions are safe, secure and support the values and ambitions you hold To learn more download my Free eBook which introduces the philosophy of Digital Balance\nDownload Free eBook ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.com/philosophy/","summary":"refine your digital interactions so they continue to support the goals and activities you want to pursue but minimise your exposure to risk and unhealthy relationships with technology\nI believe we are at a crossroads.
