[{"content":"Welcome A web browser can collect a lot of information about you. As the tool most used to browse the Internet, they can track the sites you visit, how long you spent on them, which links you clicked on or purchases you made, and much more. Choosing the right web browser is, therefore, an important consideration when trying to improve your online privacy.\nIdeally, you should choose a web browser which blocks all trackers by default, or at least, allows you to easily configure it do so. It should also put you in control of your private data, letting you decide the level of information you would like to share with a website. Of course, it should also be fast, and ideally easy to use.\nWith all these requirements it can be difficult to choose the right web browser to use. In this article, I will share some good examples of privacy respecting web browsers you can start to use today.\n Brave The brave browser was introduced in 2016 by Brandon Eich (formerly worked for Mozilla). It is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It’s built on top of Chromium, so will probably feel familiar to current Google Chrome users, making switching fairly easy.\nUnlike Chrome, Brave does not collect data about your online activities, and clearing browsing data is an easy process.\nOut of the box, it has built-in ad, tracker and malware blocking, and can be configured to provide fingerprinting protection (a topic for another post), but essentially makes users appear subtly different to each website.\nFor anyone into Cryptocurrency, Brave incorporates it’s own (BAT tokens), which enables you to anonymously reward the websites you visit most (can be switched off).\nThere have been a few reported issues with the browser, however, these do not appear to have affected user privacy. The main criticism of Brave has been the introduction of it’s own ad program, launched in April 2019. For many, this seems like a strange feature to include, for a browser which prides it’s self on blocking ads.\nLink to Brave browser  Ungoogled Chromium Chromium is an open source web browser which enables google tracking by default.\nThe Ungoogled Chromium, as the name suggests, is designed as a drop-in replacement for Chromium, minus the google content. The browser retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible, whilst removing all google tracking features. In addition, it also implements some useful features such as enforcing HTTPS (secure traffic) by default, and forcing all pop ups into tabs.\nUnlike other browsers, such as Brave, Ungoogled Chromium does not have ad and tracking blocking enabled by default, although this can be implemented using extensions and settings.\nAs a web browser, it is not particularly user friendly, and does’t auto update the browser or installed extensions (which is a good thing). This does, however, mean the user has to manually maintain these, making it a better option for advanced users.\nLink to Ungoogled Chromium  Irdium The Iridium browser is another secure browser based on the Chromium project, the same project Google Chrome is built on. It is backed by the Open Source Business Alliance, which according to Iridium, has around 190 members.\nSince Iridium is built on Chromium, it provides support for Chrome extensions and receives regular updates and releases. The source code, however, has been modified to respect user privacy.\nThe browser blocks the transmission of partial queries, keywords and metrics to other web services, however, this can be enabled by the user should they wish.\nLink to Iridium browser  Firefox The Firefox browser was first introduced in 2002, and is developed by a nonprofit organisation, Mozilla. Currently, it is the third most widely used web browser on the Internet, behind Google’s Chrome (49.3% market share) and Apple’s Safari (31.6%).\nOut of the box, the default privacy settings are not as strong as other browsers (e.g. Brave) , however, Firefox is well known for it’s customisability, making it a popular alternative to Google, Microsoft, and Apple. For example, while Firefox does not automatically block advertisements, there are numerous browser extensions that can be installed to improve security and privacy. Related: DF Tube: How to resist the Blackhole of YouTube\nFirefox does collect some telemetry data, which, they say, is used to improve performance and stability. For example, it will record data about your interactions, such as the number of tabs you open, websites you visit, and plugins you install. In addition, technical data such as the operating system you use, memory etc is also collected. It is, however, an easy task to disable the collection of this data, so be sure to do this as part of the recommended Firefox customisation .\nLink to Firefox browser  Tor The Tor browser was developed by the Tor Project in 2002. It’s name is derived from an acronym of the original software project name The Onion Router. When using Tor, your activity and identity are masked, and encrypted in at least three layers (like layers of an onion).\nThe browser is based on Firefox, and uses the Tor network to route your web traffic across the internet. It allows users to access the internet anonymously, since while websites (and your ISP) know that you are connecting through Tor, they cannot identify you. Anonymity is achieved by routing your web traffic around a distributed network of volunteer (thousands) computers, so your path through the internet is effectively hidden. In doing so, your ISP now only knows where you entered the Tor network , not where you exited. Therefore, they cannot identify you when you visit a website on the other end of the communication (when you exit the Tor network).\nOut of the box, Tor is very secure. It does not track your browsing history and will clear your cookies at the end of a session. In addition, the browser includes some builtin protection such as fingerprinting protection.\nThe use of the Tor network can, however, make browsing quite slow (especially streaming). It’s high level of default protection can also break many websites, making them unusable, or littered with endless CAPTCHA verifications. Finally, Tor is often simply blocked by websites, meaning you will not even be able to view them. One way around this is to use the Tor browser with the Tor network disabled, although in this case, it’s probably easierto just use Firefox.\nLink to Tor browser  Survey Results While researching the content for this article, I surveyed my mailing list about their password security habits. Here’s what I found.\n 86% (+) of people use Google Chrome for web browsing 54% of people say they use the same web browser on all their devices 60% of people sync their data (browsing history, bookmarks etc) across all their devices 53% (+) of people allow their browser to save their passwords for websites they visit 100% of people use a browser which blocks pop-ups or adverts  Take aways:\nFrom the results, it’s clear that there is a heavy reliance on Google for online interactions.\n  Google Chrome is heavily used, with higher usage than the overall market share (49.3%)\n  A significant number of people are also syncing data through google’s platform, potentially linking individual activities together (data linkability will be discussed in a future post).\n   Recommendations Disclaimer: The advice I am about to share is specifically targeted to subscribers of my mailing list, although it is probably applicable more broadly. I regularly poll my mailing list and respond to their questions regarding their digital habits. If you would like to receive the right advice for you, join the mailing list .\n General Tips:   Everyone should consider an alternative to Google Chrome.\n  Avoid signing up for new websites with your google account, or even Facebook. Sign up with a separate email address and password (again to reduce data linkability).\n  You do not need to stick to using one web browser. It can be advantageous to group activities and use a different web browser for each (more on this in a future post).\n  There is no perfect web browser, but if you go with one of the above examples you shouldn’t go too wrong.\n   Recommended Web Browser Regular browsing/skill level (most people, daily internet browsing)\n Choose a browser that you are comfortable using Choose a browser that supports extensions you may want to use (avoid too many) Choose a browser which offers the best out of the box privacy Use more than one browser as required.   I recommend Brave or Firefox (with recommended privacy configuration applied)\n Anonymous browsing/Advanced skill level (browsing you would like to keep anonymous)\n Choose a browser which allows you to customise the settings to your needs. Use multiple browsers as required If using Tor, do not login to your online identities while browsing the web on the same session. Tor doesn’t magically protect you from data you submit to websites. This can still be seen! If using Tor, do not install any plugins or make any customisations. Doing so will could make you stand out from the crowd, and therefore, potentially more traceable.   I recommend Firefox (general surfing) and Tor (if you need the best anonymity)\n  Finally, switching to a secure web browser is going to drastically improve your digital privacy.\nUsing a secure web browser contributes to the Protect strategy of my Digital Balance philosophy, which encourages us to:\n refine our digital interactions so they continue to support the goals and activities we want to pursue but minimise our exposure to risk and unhealthy relationships with technology \u0026ndash; Dr CD McDermott ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/best-web-browser-for-privacy-in-2020/","summary":"Welcome A web browser can collect a lot of information about you.

Many advertisers and sponsors have suspended advertising on Facebook, and some big names have left twitter (they were banned to be fair) moving to it’s “anything goes” rival paler. What better week to share a review of Christopher Wylie’s book: Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica’s Plot to Break the World.\nLast week as I sat down to write a review I came across a great video on YouTube by Dan White , who kindly offered to share his review with subscribers of my mailing list (join the list to hear everything first). Dan provides unique and thought provoking book reviews and discussion. Enjoy the review.\nBook review  The Book That Almost Made We Want to Delete Facebook\n Facebook has become something of a monster in modern day society; what first started as a website for college students has fast become the most popular online space on the planet, with people of all ages posting content from all over the world, and although Facebook’s aim is to connect people and families there is a great deal more happening across the platform. Opinions are posted, stories are shared, and there’s no real way to filter any of it, some may argue it would be pointless to try and control this information, but can Facebook really be left alone? Couple this with the mass amounts of data the company holds on people, and you have a website in a great position of power, with next to no regulation and only arbitrary rules regarding what should and should not be posted, but Facebook is certainly not immune to scandals and no more is this made apparent in Christopher Wylie’s, Mindf*ck — a book with an outlandish title, and one hell of a story regarding the abuse of personal data.\nFacebook is like the habit you can’t kick. You try to remove it from your life and suddenly you may notice you’ve lost access to lots of other sites, that’s mainly because details on Facebook are actively used to sign up to websites so we can avoid the whole boring process of inputting personal data, take that way and it’s goodbye to those accounts — it’s like facing withdrawal. Let Facebook take control and you can sign up to a website in no time at all, but take away Facebook and suddenly you’ve lost the majority of access. Take Facebook away and suddenly you feel a little disconnected with the world, as if everyone is having a big party that you’re not invited to. Of course that’s an exaggeration, but with the world on Facebook, getting rid of it can make you feel isolated even if the reality is false.\nI’m sure you noticed in the title for this very book review, I stated that this book made me want to delete Facebook from my life, and let me assure you that statement is true. I’ve been thinking about taking the plunge (as it were) for some time, and it still remains the case. For too long I’ve questioned the continued uses of Facebook in a time where it feels so powerful, imposing and in a great sense, unnecessary, at least on the surface. With past data being thrown around willy nilly, one has to ask what such a monopoly corporation is doing with it all. But as you may know, leaving a website that has its arms stretching out in all directions is no easy thing. For to solely walk out on Facebook in these modern times, that puts a wall up too many, many people, and no matter how much we may not like it, or even wish to believe it, with the world on Facebook, one person leaving is at a big disadvantage, particularly in the digital world. I’m making the point that Facebook is powerful, people rarely give it up, people rarely think about what Facebook is even doing, and for those who do go offline for good, certain connections taper off. Now with such power should come supervision, regulation, but in the view of Facebook this is far from the case. It is a business unique in its position, and so maybe after this book review you too, may feel a little less comfortable when scrolling through that infinite feed of content tailored. Just. For. You.\nAuthor Christopher Wylie speaks of his difficulty growing up in a world not quite to his own mould. When younger he was treated differently, and felt a stranger to others for the fact he used a wheelchair to get around. He states it was this alienation that drove him to computers. Like most who excel in coding and computer sciences Wylie spent most of his younger years in front of a screen, this later developing him the skills needed to create a system of mass data harvesting and from such, the manipulation that followed. His later interest in politics combined with his keep aptitude for data landed him various jobs, including a brief stint with the Liberal Democrats party in the UK. Wylie finds himself working for a company called SCL and later a subsidiary known as Cambridge Analytica. It is here where he works on data harvesting products for various clients, and explains to the reader exactly what that means. No doubt you’ve heard of Cambridge Analytica, but no one really seems to know exactly what was going on between Facebook and this little known company, at least not in a concise understanding. There’s a reason Christopher Wylie is now permanently banned from Facebook.\nIn an age of nuclear bombs, tanks, fighter jets and god knows how many other war machines on this planet, you may wonder why the hell data is so important, and furthermore why it is important to people in countries of war and to people in countries of peace. That right there is what this book does a brilliant job of explaining, for it’s not the data itself that is important, it’s what people, and corporations do with it. In particular Cambridge Analytica went above and beyond the ways it harvested and used data for the benefits of it’s own investors, and interests. But why oh why is data so important I hear you ask? Some people may assume that scammers and wannabe criminals are the biggest threats, but that is far from the case. Let’s start first with how Cambridge Analytica even managed to get all that data in the first place. Well here my friends is the kicker, and one reason alone as to why you should read this book.\nNot long ago at all, Facebook was able to share data without your consent, whenever you used a specific app that had been designed on the platform. And it gets worse than that. Imagine you never even used one of these apps. Let’s say you have a friend called James. Say James used that app, well Facebook would not only pull the data from James’ profile and send it to the app developers, but from every single one of his friend’s profiles, and if you’re his friend, then tough luck, because your data has been banked and shipped off for whatever use fits the purpose. And it doesn’t take a genius to work out that the data you input into Facebook is of a deeply personal nature, in some cases it could be used to identify you to a higher degree of accuracy than even your own parents. This is the world we find ourselves living in Christopher Wylie’s book, and the awful fact of the matter is that this book is not a fictional story. It is an account from a real person, who first hand saw these abuses and passed evidence on to prove it.\nWith such mass data Cambridge Analytica began consulting with psychology professors and put together personality profiles that would identify people with specific personality traits. They would then release their digital arsenal and target these people in an effort to sway opinion. They expertly crafted fake news, false stories, communities, adverts, videos and targeted people across the globe to sway popular opinion of leaders, corporations or whoever was the highest bidder. With millions upon millions of data Cambridge analytica could fabricate a society and tweak it as they please. The implications are shocking, and this book goes on to take this notion of data manipulation further as to say that both the US Presidential election and Brexit vote were manipulated by the hand of Cambridge Analytica, feeding people false stories, sometimes subtle, other times not, and swaying there vote in a method far more effective than a simple leaflet through a letter box. And it is for this reason Wylie felt he had to tell this tale.\nConclusions Bold claims from a bold book, that I certainly enjoyed reading, despite in parts how often unnerving it is. I must warn, there are some shocking statements within these pages, and ones that certainly warrant further investigation, but what this book does so well is explain the shocking ways in which your data can be used to create a virtual space in where you live. This space can be tweaked, can be bombarded with content to influence your decisions through psychological profiling. Articles are recommended to you that either support your points or perhaps seek to weaken them. And that’s scary, because how many times are you recommended something in a day? And how many times did you ask for it? Your virtual life and the content provided is churned out through a dozen algorithms and you may never know who or what is controlling them. And that there is the sickly horror of this tale.\nSo while we can all moan about Facebook and blissfully disregard the notion of data harvesting as boring and irrelevant, perhaps even the whole debate about regulation, upon reading this book it becomes abundantly clear that such topics are of the utmost importance. Ignorance is bliss until you realise you’ve been manipulated by more than just an advert displaying some clothes you quite fancy buying. People would not so easily pass the keys to their house around the local bar, but seem to be perfectly fine inputting all their information online perhaps because they assume it’s in good hands, but behind the scenes it’s been used to drum up fear and hatred for whatever cause has the highest bidder, and so this book plays out as more a work of horror than a piece of nonfiction, and how sad that is to type… Next time you’re told to sign up to any old thing, with details saved in any old place, stop and think exactly what it is you are revealing and to what you are giving, because I can certainly imagine you would never write a letter with a sizeable chunk of information, stamp your address, and post it off to a company perching on Mayfair, yet as time has passed little to nothing has changed online. Some people got a slap on the wrist but the machine keeps turning, and odds are, we’re all part of the oil that keeps it running.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/minfckinsidecambridgeanalyticasplottobreaktheworld/","summary":"Introduction It seems an appropriate week to be talking about social media.

Who doesn’t like to watch cats and babies doing funny things, or learn how to replace a door catch on your dishwater to avoid an expensive plumbers bill. But, if you impulsively watch more and more videos and compulsively log in more frequently, even when you had planned to do something more productive, you may be addicted. In this article I will share some tips on how to avoid the black hole of YouTube using, amongst other things, DF Tube a plugin for Firefox.\nTips If this sounds familiar, do not worry, you not alone. With a little bit of willpower, and a clear strategy, you can overcome this issue and return to using the technology in a happy and healthy manner. You will need to find the right strategy for you, but here are some tips to try:\n Schedule a specific time of day, say 6-7pm when you are allowed to use the platform. Do not be tempted to extend this time. Having a strict limit will force you to be more selective in the content you watch. Remove the YouTube app from your phone. When trying to break a habit it is useful to add some friction, in order to make the activity more difficult to do. Removing the app from your phone means whenever you are bored, stood in a queue or waiting for a bus, you will not be tempted to watch a few sneaky videos. Now the only time you can watch a video is when you are sat in front of your computer, where you can monitor your time more easily. The added benefit is that you might find yourself talking to more people or reading an educational or entertaining book. Unsubscribe from any channels you may be following, and only add a few carefully selected channels back in, which you really enjoy or add value to your life. Install a Distraction blocking plug-in for your web browser. For Google Chrome (In the future I am going to show you why should move away from Chrome) there a several good options, one being DF Tube or for Firefox you could try DF Tube . These plug-in allow you to watch your chosen videos, but remove all the distractions from the side bars which YouTube uses to entice you to spend more time on the platform. Remember, the business model of YouTube (and most social media platforms for that matter) is to keep you hooked on their platform for as long as possible. Clicking links, watching more videos, leaving comments ultimately creates more revenue for them.  Using these tips and a little willpower, you should now be able to enjoy YouTube in a happier and healthier way. You still get to watch all your great videos, but hopefully you can now be more intentional in the way you use the platform, and don’t fall into the trap of loosing hours of time clicking on random videos you never intended to watch in the first place.\nInstallation guide For a quick guide on how to install the Chrome version, follow the Video below which I found on YouTube (see I still think YouTube is awesome), in which the guy does a great job showing you how to get started.\n   question ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/dftube-how-to-watch-youtube-distraction-free/","summary":"YouTube is awesome.

I started my Blog and mailing list . It’s something I have been thinking about doing for a while, but always managed to find an excuse not to start, sound familiar ? This got me thinking about a quote I recently heard by Stoic philosopher, Epictetus:\n If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid - Epictetus\n I think his point is that often the fear of looking foolish can cripple us and prevent us from starting a new venture or applying for a dream job or starting a blog. If we are not careful we can place too much importance on social validation and caring what other people think. Of course, it’s good to value other people’s opinions, using these to guide and keep us accountable for our actions. But, when this need is out of balance we can loose authenticity and succumb to fear. So how can we avoid this trap ?\n At the risk of sounding harsh, remember that everyone is far too busy worrying about their own lives, and what others think about them, to even remotely care about what we are doing. If, as Epictetus says, we are content to be thought foolish, the ‘fear of what others think’ will no longer be a stumbling block.  I raise the second point, in particular, for a reason. While I have been considering how we use technology and the impact of social media, I think this point is at the centre of how we can choose to use technology healthily. The fear of what others think can manifest itself as a form of hidden self inflicted censorship where we are sometimes scared to share out real thoughts on a subject, and rather choose to comply with the ‘herd mentality’. In addition, the need for social validation can lead to a dangerous position where our inner self-worth is governed by what others think of us. A point professional sport climber, Madison Fischer eloquently raised on her blog saying:\n I wanted the congratulations. I wanted admiration. I wanted my follower count to grow. I wanted everyone to envy my life and achievements. I wanted, no, needed people to tell me I was going places - Madison Fischer\n If we are not careful the need for others to validate our self worth, and the fear of what they may think about us, can lead us to craft highly curated artificial lives online. Only showing the good parts, portraying a life that is neither authentic or reflective of who we really are. If this was not bad enough, it can lead others to desire our artificial life, lead them to question the value of their own, ultimately reducing their own belief of self worth. A harmful cycle on a downward trajectory. Cal newport raises the deeper question lurking beneath this debate, and one that I will also leave us all to consider:\n Are these services making you a better or worse version of yourself ?\n ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/our-need-for-validation-through-social-media/","summary":"So last week I took the plunge.

In doing so, it joins a host of other countries (including Germany, Italy and Denmark) to favour a decentralised system developed by the Silicon Valley giants, rather than a centralised model developed locally. A step in the right direction ?\nThere has been much debate and concern about the need and function of contact tracing apps to fight the current global pandemic. Indeed, the Ada Lovelace Institute has previously questioned whether any such system was needed and would be safe, fair and equitable stating:\n There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of digital contact tracing as an effective technology to support the pandemic response - Ada Lovelace Institute\n Other points of note from their rapid evidence review highlight that effective deployment of technology to support the transition from the crisis will be contingent on public trust and confidence. Also, that legislation should be advanced to regulate data processing to impose strict purpose, access and time limitations. Finally, until a robust and credible means of immunity testing is developed, focus should be on considering the deep societal implications of any immunity certification regime, rather than on developing digital immunity certificates.\nThe debate continued when a number of leading scientists and researchers in the field of security and privacy also raised concerns about the original plans of NHSX to deploy a contact tracing application. They produced a joint statement raising concerns about the proposal to record centrally the de-anonymised IDs of infected people and also the IDs of all those with whom the infected person has been in contact. They highlighted that the facility could (via mission creep) lead to a form of future surveillance unless the usual data protection principle is applied: collect the minimum data necessary to achieve the objective of the application.\n We hold it is vital that if you are to build the necessary trust in the application the level of data being collected is justified publicly by the public health teams demonstrating why this is truly necessary rather than simply the easiest way, or a “nice to have”, given the dangers involved and invasive nature of the technology\n Finally, they sought assurance from the NHSX regarding how it planned to phase out the application after the pandemic has passed to prevent mission creep.\nThis joint statement came hot on the heels of a previous wider joint statement by a group of international scientists and researchers who raised similar concerns and provided a set of principles which they feel should be followed, namely:\n Contact tracing Apps must only be used to support public health measures for the containment of COVID-19. The system must not be capable of collecting, processing, or transmitting any more data than what is necessary to achieve this purpose. Any considered solution must be fully transparent. The protocols and their implementations, including any sub-components provided by companies, must be available for public analysis. The processed data and if, how, where, and for how long they are stored must be documented unambiguously. Such data collected should be minimal for the given purpose. When multiple possible options to implement a certain component or functionality of the app exist, then the most privacy-preserving option must be chosen. Deviations from this principle are only permissible if this is necessary to achieve the purpose of the app more effectively, and must be clearly justified with sunset provisions.

However, interestingly according to Forbes during this time, many of the same companies responsible for powering the recent decade-long bull market have gained even more clout, with tech behemoths Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft now accounting for over 22% of the S\u0026amp;P. That’s up from a 15 % share in 2018. To put that into perspective, according to New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo…\n The “frightful five” — Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook — are collectively more powerful than many governments - Farhad Manjoo\n This pandemic is arguably the largest crisis of our generation, but even with a great deal of uncertainty around our ability to get out of this, it looks like big tech firms may come out of this even stronger. According to NYU professor Scott Galloway the likes of Google and Amazon could gain more power by tightening their grip on the supply chain and e-commerce, with a hundred billion dollars of grocery shopping moving online to tech giants such as Walmart or Amazon. This is obviously great news for shareholders, but not for small companies struggling to survive, furloughing or laying off staff to reduce costs. And while this corporate culling takes place, the likes of Walmart and Amazon continue to consolidate the marketplace, buying up small companies on the cheap to increase their ever expanding empire.\nMake no mistake, the big tech companies, like google, have enough cash on hand to survive the pandemic. They could, should they wish, buy the likes of Boeing and Airbus. Let that sink in for a minute ! Indeed, the trend is evident already with Facebook buying Giphy and investing in geo marketing, while many high street stores go into administration.\nSo what does a post covid-19 look like ? Well, the truth is many of these big tech companies were arguably already too powerful before the pandemic hit. They were often criticised for stifling innovation, avoiding taxes and not being held accountable when their platforms are weaponised, even when it threatens democracy. In post covid-19, when a culling of the corporate herd has taken place, there will be less companies competing for the same number of customers. Less competition is never good for citizens or the economy, especially when the few already yield so much influence and power over our lives. And worringly, that is what I think we are going to see here …\n When the rains return after the culling of the herd there’s more foliage for fewer elephants\n ","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/big-tech-influence-to-grow-post-covid/","summary":"I probably don’t need to tell you the markets have been on a wild ride in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak.

The truth is, on our quest to find the perfect tool, we mostly likely waste time, reduce productivity, and are less happy with the results of our efforts. It’s important to remember a tool is there to help, it cannot do the job for you, and it’s effectiveness is often dependent on the skill of the person using it. Just like a great knife will not make you a great chef, a tool isn’t a substitute for skill.\nI was recently reading the bio section on Derek Sivers and was interested to see his description of the tools he uses, and more importantly his perspective on the perfect tool.\n All of my current creative and learning goals can be achieved with these existing tools, so I avoid that time-sinking habit of looking for new ones - Derek Sivers\n This seems like a sensible approach to tool selection and productivity, which could help us escape the endless and fruitless pursuit of better. My advice is to clearly define what you need a tool to do. If it is successful against those requirements, stick with it. By being specific about what you need to accomplish with the tool, you are focusing on having a tool that works, which is more important than having the best.\n","permalink":"https://cdmcdermott.github.io/articles/does-the-perfect-tool-or-app-exits/","summary":"If you are like me the search to find the perfect tool or app is never ending.

Therefore, no matter what you do online it’s important that you know what kind of trail you’re leaving, and what the possible effects can be.\nOne of the motivating factors for starting this blog is to explore these concepts in detail and encourage us all to be more intentional with our digital lives.

To understand that hackers and cyber criminals will stop at nothing to obtain this personal information and engage in a variety of harmful activities.\nI want to encourage you to think critically about the technology you use, and how to manage your online activity.

Perhaps, like me you only recently heard the term and let out a slight groan, conflating the idea with the wider, more popular trending philosophy of Minimalism, in which people live a life with less stuff (I’m minimalising the philosophy there).\nLet me clear, I like the idea of Minimalism. I have even tried to adopt some principles in my life, although all attempts have ended in failure as we are a family of hoarders. Note to self…. I must return to explore the philosophy. In addition, let me also state, I am huge advocate for technology, I teach it every day in my day job. However, I now see both sides of the equation, and want to help us be more intentional in the way we use it.\nDigital Minimalism\nBack to the Digital version of the philosophy. I first learned about this area after hearing an interview with Cal Newport, a Computer Science Professor who also writes about deep work and intentional living. After reading his book: Digital Minimalism on the topic, I now understand the thinking behind it, and see the value in the philosophy. If nothing else, it is worth some thought and consideration.\nThe justification for the philosophy is that technology has permeated into every facet of our lives. Many times (as is the case with Social Media) the technology is designed to maximise our attention and interactions, which can often lead to the manipulation and monetisation of our thoughts and values by large tech companies. In addition, technology addiction, our obsessive phone checking, and validation from social media platforms is becoming an increasing problem in society.\n  Stood in the queue at Tesco …. flip the phone out rather than talk to someone.\n  Waiting at the bus stop …. fill the gap with mindless information on our phone.\n  Out on a date …. check-in on Facebook to tell everyone what your doing, rather than enjoying the moment.\n  Digital Minimalism is a call to discover a different way of approaching technology. Newport defines it as a philosophy in which you:\n focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else - Cal Newport\n It is founded in the belief that less is more (borrowed from its parent Minimalism philosophy) when it comes to new digital tools. That a carefully curated list of technologies can provide value to your life, but beyond this many are simply a distraction, which consume vast qualities of your time and limit more meaningful actions and interactions with others.\nIf your phone usage, Facebook scrolling, or Twitter addiction has ever caused you concern, then my hope with this blog is to help you recognise and start a new journey and relationship with technology. In particular with our phones. For example, would a better use of your time be to meet a friend for coffee once a month or call a relative for a half-hour each week, than spending that time observing their posted photos and clicking ‘like’ as a means of staying in touch?\nIf you believe so, join me on this journey and share your experience and tips.

The Artful Dodger was a pickpocket, so called for his skill and cunning in that occupation.\nArtful (adjective) in clever and skilful ways\nEnigma (noun) a person or thing that is mysterious or difficult to understand\nSince I value my freedom and privacy I try to cultivate skills which enable me to remain mysterious online and thus maintain my privacy and security.\n What I am thinking about For those who are new to my work, I’ve created a short summary of the main ideas I explore in my writing.\n Human-centred Security: By understanding humans and their interaction with technologies, controls and data I explore the circumstances where psychological-related errors may lead to security incidents. Attackers have been using methods of psychological manipulation to coerce humans into making errors for years. I seek to understand and manage psychological vulnerabilities, and explore technology and controls that are designed with human behaviour in mind.\n  Human commoditisation through technology: I am interested in exploring the mismatch between our natural human sensitivities and the exponential growth, power and influence of technology. I seek to raise awareness about the massive extraction and monetisation of our thoughts, emotions, and actions; and the resultant harmful side effects, such as our need for social validation, and breakdown of truth.\n  Human dependance on technology: Technology has permeated into every area of our lives. However, a severe over reliance, or an addiction to certain facets of its use, can have devastating effects on our health. While technology can fulfil our natural human need for stimulation and interaction, it can also impact the pleasure systems of the brain, and be used as a boredom buster, social lubricant, or escape from reality. I seek to explore ways to be more intentional with our use of technology, using it to support our goals and values, rather than letting it use us.\n  What I am working on now I am currently exploring the issues highlighted above and assimilating this into an appropriate strategies and philosophy.\nMy aim is to help us optimise our use of technology such that all our digital interactions are safe, healthy and support the values and ambitions we each hold.\n See more here: philosophy\n  Selected Published work   M.
